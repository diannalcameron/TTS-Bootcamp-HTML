        <h1>Food I Make in My Kitchen</h1>
        <p>Admittedly not a lot these days, because having a baby is time consuming!</p>

        <h2>If I do get to cook, I'll most often make:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Tacos (lots and lots of tacos)</li>
            <li>Pasta (often with a homemade cream sauce)</li>
            <li>Curry (on the milder side, with lots of veggies)</li>
            <li>Smoothies (sometimes in a bowl with toppings)</li>
            <li>Salads (quick, easy, and healthy)</li>
            <li>Cocktails (they count as food, right?)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>I'd rather eat out somewhere!</h2>
        <p>
            Well, suit yourself. <a href="restaurants.html" target="_self">Take me back!</a>
